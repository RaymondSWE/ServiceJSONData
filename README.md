Hey, I tried to create a UML diagram for how i would structure it and I would solve it step by step. Please send your github username so I can add you to the repository, as I want to be transparent with the timing and that i was within the threshold. 

The code is pretty simple, the models holds the data. The service handle logic, and the custom excpetion sends objects, which I used the builder design pattern to implement these.

Everything is tested with postman the url for testing is localhost:8080/api/validate with a json body that contains the measurementdata and the nested object rawsensordata

Regards,
Raman
